droidcam
========

Play with the code and check if I can add improvements to that code

The general idea behind this fork is to see if I can add sound support streaming from the Android.
On first step will try to make some cleanup - compilation against latest ffmpeg and warnings removal,
also noticed a minor problem on the droidcam gui reading/saving port number for the remote server.
